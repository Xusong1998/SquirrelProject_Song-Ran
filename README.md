# SquirrelProject_Song-Ran

A description of what has been implemented
Final Project for the class Tools for Analytics in which we built a Django website containing different pages based on Central Park squirrel data. The page '/sightings' for looking at individual squirrel information with hyperlinks pointing to 'sightings/<unique_squirrel_id>'. '/sightings/<unique_squirrel_id>' to update and look at some attributes of a specific squirrel. '/add' to add more squirrel data by user input. '/map' to get the detailed location of squirrels on a map. 'sightings/stats' to see the statistics of all squirrels and other information such as mean, mode. Also created import and export command python scripts under '/project/management/commands/' to import and export squirrel data csv. Used Bootstrap to implement styling on webpages.
